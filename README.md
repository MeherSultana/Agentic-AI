This Python script "code.py" demonstrates how to use the Together API for generating responses via a chat model. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:
   1. Load API Key
The script uses the dotenv library to load environment variables from a .env file.
TOGETHER_API_KEY is the API key needed to authenticate requests to the Together API.
If the API key is not set, an error is raised to prevent the script from proceeding.
  2. Initialize the Together Client
The script creates a client object (client) for the Together API, initialized using the API key.
  3. Make a Chat Completion Request
The script attempts to generate a response using the Together API by invoking the chat.completions.create() method.
It specifies:
Model: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo (a variant of Meta's Llama language model).
Prompt: The user prompt, "What are the top 3 things to do in New York?"
Streaming: Enabled via stream=True to receive the response incrementally.
The script loops through the streamed response, printing it chunk by chunk
Error Handling: If an exception occurs, it prints the error message.
